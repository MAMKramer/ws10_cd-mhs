AIRoV 2024 is the joint symposium of the [Austrian Society for
Artificial Intelligence (ASAI)](https://www.asai.ac.at/), the
[Austrian Society of Measurement, Automation and Robot Technologies
(GMAR)](https://www.gmar.at/), and the [Austrian Association for
Pattern Recognition (OAGM)](https://aapr.at/). Following a long
tradition of individual and joint [OAGM](https://aapr.at/?page_id=43)
and [ARW](https://roboticsworkshop.at/)/GMAR workshops, this is the
first joint symposium of our three closely-related associations.

Our objective is to bring together our overlapping communities, foster
exchange, develop synergies, develop common visions and ambitions,
enhance the visibilty of our activities, and provide a forum for the
next generation of researchers.

The program will be built around two half-day sessions of parallel
workshops. Workshops will focus on topics of interest to at least two
of the participating communities, and can run over one or both
sessions.

In addition, there will be plenary sessions featuring keynote
presentations, contributed talks, and a poster session.
